The method for getting pH1000 data onto a PC by ethernet connection is described here.

= Introduction =

The BCSI pH1000 v3.4 system is designed to allow a PC to log onto the instrument by FTP and download a "test_info" file.  This is described in Appendix C of the users manual.  BCSI does not provide software solutions for users to get data off the pH1000 as this is a very customized and specific activity for users's LIS systems.  One method of collecting data using batch files is described here.


= Details =

There are a few steps that need to be done and most of these commands can be handled with batch files, which execute a series of command line actions.

  * FTP into pH1000 and download test records
  * Make a time stamp to append to file name
  * Define the pH1000 serial number
  * Add UnitSN and date stamp to the file
  * Rename the file
  * Check for new records else delete file

Use the *pH1000_ftp.bat* and *pH1000_ftp.scr* files to automatically perform these tasks.  The IP address in the pH1000_ftp.bat file will need to be edited for the specific pH1000 used.
