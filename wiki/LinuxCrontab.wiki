#summary The crontab feature in Linux can running scripts automatically based on a schedule a user defines.

= Introduction =

Once we have the FTP data downloading from pH1000s and optional emailing of files to a different location figured out it is useful to automatically call the tasks. In order for this feature to work, the computer must remain on during the time frame that it is expected to be pulling records from the pH1000.
